Welcome to our greeting file!
Hello, world! This is a classic programming greeting.
The word "hello" is often used as a test word in coding examples.
Here are some hellos in different languages:
- French: Bonjour
- Spanish: Hola
- German: Hallo
- Italian: Ciao
Sometimes, people say "hello" in unusual ways, like "Yellow!"
In texting, you might see "hello" abbreviated as "hi" or "hey".
Hello, is it me you're looking for? (That's from a famous song!)
At the end of a conversation, you might say "goodbye" instead of "hello".
